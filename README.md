This repository contains the code for an unhosted website that was created with the intent to help readers instantly discover their next read. 

You will notice that regardless of the input given, the website will produce the same graph with the same list of recommended titles. This is because the 
back end functionality has not yet been implemented, and does not currently support searching through the database. 

To access this website, simply download all files or clone the repository, and open in a preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code recommended).
